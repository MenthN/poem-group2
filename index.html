        <h1>DON'T QUIT</h1>
        <h2> Jon Greenleaf Whittier</h2>    
            <p>When things go wrong as they sometimes will,<br />
                When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,<br />
                When the funds are low and the debts are high<br />
                And you want to smile, but you have to sigh, <br />
                When care is pressing you down a bit, <br />
                Rest if you must, but don't quit<br />
            </p>
            
            <p>Life is strange with its twist and turns <br>
                As every one of us sometimes learns<br>
                And many failures comes about<br>
                When he might have won, stuck it out;<br>
                Don't give up though the pace seems slow- <br>
                You may succeed with another blow, <br>
             </p>
            <p> Success is a failure turned inside out<br>
                The silver tint of the clouds doubt, <br> 
                And you can never tell just how close you are, <br>
                It may be near when it seem so far; <br>
                So stick to the fight when you're hardest to hit-<br>
                It's when things seem worst that you must not quit<br>
            <p> For all the sad words of tongue or pen<br>
                The saddest are these: "It might have been!"<br>
